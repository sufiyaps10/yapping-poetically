Not a poet but i act to be one
Not a poem but i would loved to be once
Have you ever read what i have written on you, mam?
If u didnt let me introduce you to some

Wrote the first time when we took a walk
Wrote about the time when we used to talk
Wrote every time when i couldn't say things 
Wrote every thing when i should have not

Every other poem was about the heartbreak
Because i never thought us without one
Neither reasons were enough to keep me heartfelt
You will love it if i write about us in love

If this was my last poem for you
You wont see me writing how do i adore
But if u like any of it , mam
I would simply write a thousand more
