The first time we met
She seemed to me wise
Never felt love
But that moment i might
Was i funny was i weird
Cuz why her smile
Kept staring at my eyes

She spoke to me later
We talked for a while
She then asked my name
I fumbled , Cant define
But i kinda made her smile
Is all i recollect now
I laughed at myself then
She was way too fine
