I feel like a fool who's used to be fooled
Now the words dont hurt me even if they're cruel
In a way im loving it , i now hate all the praise
I now love all your face , i now hate all the grace 
Emotions that i hide , you will hate when i show
You wont like if i love you even more than you know
My heart was a burden then , im not used to carrying love
Love is not our way , for me you stand above

I write heavy words , i live a lousy life
My eyes with you in sight are like a gambler with no dice
I write all my curses , i show all my pain
Not to gain sympathy , but a partner in my rain
Everyone now knows , what love do i hold
For her in my heart , i know that she dont
Alot of things remains unsaid , so my poems pave the way
And my heart's full of poems now as you didnt wanted to stay
