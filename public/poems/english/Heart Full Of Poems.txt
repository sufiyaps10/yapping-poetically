I feel like a fool 
Who's used to be fooled
Now the words don't hurt me 
Even if they're cruel
In a way I am loving it 
I now hate all the praise
I now love all your face
I now hate all the grace 
Emotions that i hide 
You will hate when i show
You wont like if i love you 
Even more than you know
My heart was a burden then 
I am not used to carrying love
Love is not our way , 
For me you stand above

I write heavy words 
I live a lousy life
My eyes with you in sight are like 
A gambler with no dice
I write all my curses 
I show all my pain
Not to gain sympathy 
But a partner in my rain
Everyone now knows 
What love do i hold
For her in my heart 
I know that she dont
A lot of things remains unsaid 
So my poems pave the way
And my heart's full of poems now as you didn't wanted to stay
