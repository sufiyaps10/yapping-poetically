Every morning now upsets me
Every night is a mess
Everyday i try to find you
Everytime i see your dress

Every minute's like a burden now
Every second is a stress
Everyone now seems so loving , why?
Every where i see your face

Every where i see your smile
Everytime was in gaze
Everytime I saw your eyes

Everyday I looked for ways
Every way not to confide
Every poem's now my untold wound
Every time its you who i write
