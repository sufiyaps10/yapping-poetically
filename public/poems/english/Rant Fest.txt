Was a boy with some goals and ambitions then
Was a boy who was innocent and generous
Was a boy who was funny and who ain't rude
Was a boy who i thought i'd never lose

Was a boy who was taught how to never fail
Was a boy who would share what he always felt
Was a boy who was confident and tolerant
Was a boy who knew what he had it then

To the guy with no hopes and no meaning now
To the guy who's toxic and greedy now
To the guy in no mood when he comes around
To the guy in the crowd he was never found

To the failure who never knew he failed how
To the yapper what he feels he just writes down
To the jealousy in me which just stands out
To the delusional me with some self-doubt
