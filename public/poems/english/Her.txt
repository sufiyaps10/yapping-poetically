The very first moment 
when she was in my sight
never fell in love
but that moment i might

how beautiful is she
how funny is her smile
i saw every bit of myself
when i looked into her eyes

we talked everyday 
we laughed everytime
i smiled liked never before
she was everytime on my mind

never saw someone 
so beautiful and fine
so clumsy and kind
how can i never call her mine?
