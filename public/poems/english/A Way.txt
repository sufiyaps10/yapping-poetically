I never healed from the pain ,
I never wanted to
I love the scar you gave me
That i wanted , too
Its kinda hard to watch
that single scar fading
to its same old shade
I guess i wanted two 

Unspoken things that
I wanted to say 
In the notes now things
I wanted to convey
That i cant that i wont
Makes me feel like a poet
Those are written in my poems
I guess i just wanted a way
